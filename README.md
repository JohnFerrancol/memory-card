## Overview

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com): [Project: Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card). This project asks us to create a [Memory Card Game](https://heldersrvio.github.io/memory-card-game/), where we pull cards wrapped with information from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Learning Points

- Understanding the concepts of useEffect, to run processes outside of the React component, like fetching data from an API
